## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro/) - API library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles


### What I learned

I learnt how I can make SVG elements responsive by using viewbox attribute, among other things I learnt


### Continued development

I hope to learn more about fetching data from all API types. I also hope to improve in handling interactions between the user and my future apps


### Useful resources

- [w3 media queries](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_mediaqueries.asp) - This helped me in making the app responsive. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Styled components](https://styled-components.com/docs) - This is an amazing tool which helped me in styling components inside my react app. I'd recommend it to anyone working with react.
